# Bonita_Project-SAPRequest-

This is the learning outcome of Bonita. But due to the github management is supported only on subscription edition, here we don't have the real code( as about the community edition we can only export the model instead pushing it onto this git repository). 

So for viewing or contributing to the notes, go to Wiki pages to see details.
